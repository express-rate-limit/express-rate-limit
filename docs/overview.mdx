Express Rate Limit is a basic rate-limiting middleware for
[Express](http://expressjs.com/), used to limit repeated requests to public APIs
and/or endpoints such as password reset. Plays nice with
[express-slow-down](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-slow-down) and
[ratelimit-header-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ratelimit-header-parser).

- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit

## Use Cases

This library uses 'stores', which allows for the hit count and reset time of all
clients to be stored in an external database, or in-memory.

<Warning>
	The default `MemoryStore` stores the hit counts for clients in memory, and
	thus produces inconsistent results when running multiple servers or processes.
</Warning>

### Abuse Prevention

The default
[memory-store](https://github.com/express-rate-limit/express-rate-limit/blob/main/source/memory-store.ts)
is probably fine.

### API Rate Limit Enforcement

If you have multiple servers, or want to maintain state across app restarts, use
an [external data store](/reference/stores).

If you have multiple processes on a single server (via the
[node:cluster](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) module), you could use the
[cluster-memory-store](https://npmjs.com/package/@express-rate-limit/cluster-memory-store)
instead.

## Alternate Rate Limiters

This module was designed to only handle the basics and didn't even support
external stores initially. These other options all are excellent pieces of
software and may be more appropriate for some situations:

- [rate-limiter-flexible](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rate-limiter-flexible)
- [express-brute](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-brute)
- [rate-limiter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-limiter)
