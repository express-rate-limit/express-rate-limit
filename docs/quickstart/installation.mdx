<Note>

From `v7.4.0` onwards, the minimum supported version of Express is `v4.11`, due
to the usage of `response.append` in the implementation of the IETF draft
specification for the `RateLimit` headers. If you do not set the
`standardHeaders` option to `draft-7` or `draft-8`, you can still safely use any
version of Express, `v4.0.0` onwards.

</Note>

You can view the changes made in each version in the
[changelog](../reference/changelog).
