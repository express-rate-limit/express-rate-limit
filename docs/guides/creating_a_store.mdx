### Overview

A custom store will internally track how many hits each identifier (IP address) has received and automatically reduce that hit count as time elapses.

A `Store` **must** have the `increment`, `decrement`, and `resetKey` public methods. It may optionally have the `init` and `resetAll` public methods (for backwards compatibility with express-rate-limit versions prior to 6.0.0), as well as a `constructor` and any number of private methods.

The `increment` method is the primary interface between the middleware and the store. It adds 1 to the internal count for a key and returns an object consisting of the new internal count (`totalHits`) and the time that the count will reach 0 (`resetTime`).

The `decrement` method is used only to 'uncount' requests when one or both of the `skipSuccessfulRequests` or `skipFailedRequests` options are enabled.

The `init` method allows the store to set itself up using the options passed to the middleware. The store can get the `windowMs` option from this method.

In `package.json`, set `"peerDependencies": { "express-rate-limit": ">=6" }` if the store does not include `incr()`, or `>=2.3.0` if the store does have the `incr()` method. Also put `express-rate-limit` in the `devDependencies` with a more specific version for local testing and typescript definitions.

Examples:

- [TypeScript](#typescript)
- [JavaScript](#javascript)

### TypeScript

To create your own store in TypeScript, you must implement the `Store` interface provided by the library. Here is an example to get you started:

```ts
import rateLimit, {
  Store,
  Options,
  IncrementResponse,
} from "express-rate-limit";

/**
 * A `Store` that stores the hit count for each client.
 *
 * @public
 */
class SomeStore implements Store {
  /**
   * Some store-specific parameter.
   */
  customParam!: string;

  /**
   * The duration of time before which all hit counts are reset (in milliseconds).
   */
  windowMs!: number;

  /**
   * @constructor for `SomeStore`. Only required if the user needs to pass
   * some store specific parameters. For example, in a Mongo Store, the user will
   * need to pass the URI, username and password for the Mongo database.
   *
   * @param customParam {string} - Some store-specific parameter.
   */
  constructor(customParam: string) {
    this.customParam = customParam;
  }

  /**
   * Method that actually initializes the store. Must be synchronous.
   *
   * This method is optional, it will be called only if it exists.
   *
   * @param options {Options} - The options used to setup express-rate-limit.
   *
   * @public
   */
  init(options: Options): void {
    this.windowMs = options.windowMs;
    // ...
  }

  /**
   * Method to increment a client's hit counter.
   *
   * @param key {string} - The identifier for a client.
   *
   * @returns {IncrementResponse} - The number of hits and reset time for that client.
   *
   * @public
   */
  async increment(key: string): Promise<IncrementResponse> {
    // ...
    return {
      totalHits,
      resetTime,
    };
  }

  /**
   * Method to decrement a client's hit counter.
   *
   * @param key {string} - The identifier for a client.
   *
   * @public
   */
  async decrement(key: string): Promise<void> {
    // ...
  }

  /**
   * Method to reset a client's hit counter.
   *
   * @param key {string} - The identifier for a client.
   *
   * @public
   */
  async resetKey(key: string): Promise<void> {
    // ...
  }

  /**
   * Method to reset everyone's hit counter.
   *
   * This method is optional, it is never called by express-rate-limit.
   *
   * @public
   */
  async resetAll(): Promise<void> {
    // ...
  }
}

// Export the store so others can use it
export default SomeStore;
```

You can then use the store as follows:

```ts
import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";
import SomeStore from "./some-store.js";

const limiter = rateLimit({
  store: new SomeStore(),
});
```

### JavaScript

```js
/**
 * A `Store` that stores the hit count for each client.
 *
 * @public
 */
class SomeStore {
  /**
   * @constructor for `SomeStore`. Only required if the user needs to pass
   * some store specific parameters. For example, in a Mongo Store, the user will
   * need to pass the URI, username and password for the Mongo database.
   *
   * @param customParam {string} - Some store-specific parameter.
   */
  constructor(customParam) {
    this.customParam = customParam;
  }

  /**
   * Method that actually initializes the store. Must be synchronous.
   *
   * This method is optional, it will be called only if it exists.
   *
   * @param options {Options} - The options used to setup express-rate-limit.
   *
   * @public
   */
  init(options) {
    this.windowMs = options.windowMs;
  }

  /**
   * Method to increment a client's hit counter.
   *
   * @param key {string} - The identifier for a client.
   *
   * @returns {IncrementResponse} - The number of hits and reset time for that client.
   *
   * @public
   */
  async increment(key) {
    // ...

    return {
      totalHits, // A positive integer
      resetTime, // A JS `Date` object
    };
  }

  /**
   * Method to decrement a client's hit counter.
   *
   * @param key {string} - The identifier for a client.
   *
   * @public
   */
  async decrement(key) {
    // ...
  }

  /**
   * Method to reset a client's hit counter.
   *
   * @param key {string} - The identifier for a client.
   *
   * @public
   */
  async resetKey(key) {
    // ...
  }

  /**
   * Method to reset everyone's hit counter.
   *
   * This method is optional, it is never called by express-rate-limit.
   *
   * @public
   */
  async resetAll() {
    // ...
  }
}

// Export the store so others can use it
// ...via the CommonJS style
module.exports = SomeStore;
// ...or the ES Module style
export default SomeStore;
```

You can then use the store as follows:

```ts
// Use `const ... = require('...')` instead if you are using CommonJS
import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";
import SomeStore from "./some-store.js";

const limiter = rateLimit({
  store: new SomeStore(),
});
```
