## `windowMs`

> `number`

Time frame for which requests are checked/remembered. Also used in the
`Retry-After` header when the limit is reached.

<Note>

For stores that do not implement the `init` function (see the
[stores table](#stores) below), you may need to configure this value twice, once
here and once on the store. In some cases the units also differ (e.g. seconds vs
miliseconds).

</Note>

Defaults to `60000` ms (= 1 minute).

## `limit`

> `number | function`
>
> Renamed in v7.x from `max` to `limit`. However, `max` will still be supported
> for backwards-compatibility.

The maximum number of connections to allow during the `window` before rate
limiting the client.

Can be the limit itself as a number or a (sync/async) function that accepts the
Express `req` and `res` objects and then returns a number.

<Warning>

As of version 7.0.0, setting `max` to zero will no longer disable the rate
limiter - instead, it will 'block' all requests to that endpoint.

</Warning>

Defaults to `5`.

An example of using a function:

```ts
const isPremium = async (user) => {
	// ...
}

const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	limit: async (req, res) => {
		if (await isPremium(req.user)) return 10
		else return 5
	},
})
```

## `message`

> `any`

The response body to send back when a client is rate limited.

May be a string, JSON object, or any other value that Express's
[res.send](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.send) method supports. It
can also be a (sync/async) function that accepts the Express request and
response objects and then returns a `string`, JSON object or any other value the
Express `res.send` function accepts.

Defaults to `'Too many requests, please try again later.'`

An example of using a function:

```ts
const isPremium = async (user) => {
	// ...
}

const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	message: async (req, res) => {
		if (await isPremium(req.user))
			return 'You can only make 10 requests every hour.'
		else return 'You can only make 5 requests every hour.'
	},
})
```

## `statusCode`

> `number`

The HTTP status code to send back when a client is rate limited.

Defaults to `429`.

<Note>

The HTTP status code `429` is defined in
[section 4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6585#section-4) of IETF's
RFC 6585.

</Note>

## `legacyHeaders`

> `boolean`
>
> Renamed in `6.x` from `headers` to `legacyHeaders`.

Whether to send the legacy rate limit headers for the limit
(`X-RateLimit-Limit`), current usage (`X-RateLimit-Remaining`) and reset time
(if the store provides it) (`X-RateLimit-Reset`) on all responses. If set to
`true`, the middleware also sends the `Retry-After` header on all blocked
requests.

Defaults to `true`.

<Note>

Note that this option only defaults to `true` for backward compatibility, and it
is recommended to set it to `false` and use `standardHeaders` instead.

</Note>

## `standardHeaders`

> `boolean` | `'draft-6'` | `'draft-7'`
>
> Renamed in `6.x` from `draft_polli_ratelimit_headers` to `standardHeaders`.

Whether to enable support for headers conforming to the
[RateLimit header fields for HTTP standardization draft](https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi/ratelimit-headers)
adopted by the IETF.

If set to `draft-6`, separate `RateLimit-Policy` `RateLimit-Limit`,
`RateLimit-Remaining`, and, if the store supports it, `RateLimit-Reset` headers
are set on the response, in accordance with the
[sixth draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers-06)
of the IETF rate limit header specification.

If set to `draft-7`, a combined `RateLimit` header is set containing limit,
remaining, and reset values, and a `RateLimit-Policy` header is set, in
accordiance with the
[seventh draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers-07)
of the IETF rate limit header specification. `windowMs` is used for the reset
value if the store does not provide a reset time.

If set to `true`, it is treated as `draft-6`, however, this behavior may change
in a future semver major release.

If set to any truthy value, the middleware also sends the `Retry-After` header
on all blocked requests.

The `standardHeaders` option may be used in conjunction with, or instead of the
`legacyHeaders` option.

<Note>

Tip: use the
[ratelimit-header-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ratelimit-header-parser)
library in clients to read/parse any form of headers.

</Note>

Defaults to `false`.

## `requestPropertyName`

> `string`

The name of the property on the Express `request` object to store the rate limit
info.

Defaults to `'rateLimit'`.

## `skipFailedRequests`

> `boolean`

When set to `true`, failed requests won't be counted. Request considered failed
when the `requestWasSuccessful` option returns `false`. By default, this means
requests fail when:

- the response status >= `400`
- the request was cancelled before last chunk of data was sent (response `close`
  event triggered)
- the response `error` event was triggered by response

<Note>

Technically, the requests are counted and then un-counted, so a large number of
slow requests all at once could still trigger a rate-limit. This may be fixed in
a future release. PRs welcome!

</Note>

Defaults to `false`.

## `skipSuccessfulRequests`

> `boolean`

If `true`, the library will (by default) skip all requests that are considered
'failed' by the `requestWasSuccessful` function. By default, this means requests
succeed when the response status code less than `400`.

<Note>

Technically, the requests are counted and then un-counted, so a large number of
slow requests all at once could still trigger a rate-limit. This may be fixed in
a future release. PRs welcome!

</Note>

Defaults to `false`.

## `keyGenerator`

> `function`

Method to retrieve custom identifiers for clients, such as their IP address,
username, or API Key.

Should be a (sync/async) function that accepts the Express `request` and
`response` objects and then returns a string.

By default, the client's IP address is used:

```ts
const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	keyGenerator: (req, res) => req.ip,
})
```

<Note>

If a `keyGenerator` returns the same value for every user, it becomes a global
rate limiter. This could be combined with a second instance of
`express-rate-limit` to have both global and per-user limits.

</Note>

## `handler`

> `function`

Express request handler that sends back a response when a client is
rate-limited.

By default, sends back the `statusCode` and `message` set via the `options`,
similar to this:

```ts
const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	handler: (req, res, next, options) =>
		res.status(options.statusCode).send(options.message),
})
```

## `skip`

> `function`

Function to determine whether or not this request counts towards a client's
quota. Should be a (sync/async) function that accepts the Express `request` and
`response` objects and then returns `true` or `false`.

Could also act as an allowlist for certain keys:

```ts
const allowlist = ['192.168.0.56', '192.168.0.21']

const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	skip: (req, res) => allowlist.includes(req.ip),
})
```

By default, it skips no requests:

```ts
const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	skip: (req, res) => false,
})
```

## `requestWasSuccessful`

> `function`

Method to determine whether or not the request counts as 'succesful'. Used when
either `skipSuccessfulRequests` or `skipFailedRequests` is set to true. Should
be a (sync/async) function that accepts the Express `req` and `res` objects and
then returns `true` or `false`.

By default, requests with a response status code less than `400` are considered
successful:

```ts
const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	requestWasSuccessful: (req, res) => res.statusCode < 400,
})
```

## `validate`

> `boolean | Object`

When enabled, a set of validation checks are run at creation and on the first
request to detect common misconfigurations with proxies, etc. Prints an error to
the console if any issue is detected.

Automatically disables after the first request is processed.

If set to `true` or `false`, all validations are enabled or disabled.

If set to an object, individual validations can be enabled or disabled by name,
and the key `default` controls all unspecified validations. For example:

```js
const limiter = rateLimit({
	validate: {
		xForwardedForHeader: false,
		default: true,
	},
	// ...
})
```

Supported validations are:

- [ip](/reference/error-codes#ip)
- [trustProxy](/reference/error-codes#trustProxy)
- [xForwardedForHeader](/reference/error-codes#xForwardedForHeader)
- [positiveHits](/reference/error-codes#positiveHits)
- [singleCount](/reference/error-codes#singleCount)
- [limit](/reference/error-codes#limit)
- [draftPolliHeaders](/reference/error-codes#draftPolliHeaders)
- [onLimitReached](/reference/error-codes#onLimitReached)
- [headersResetTime](/reference/error-codes#headersResetTime)
- [validationsConfig](/reference/error-codes#validationsConfig)

Defaults to `true`.

## `store`

> `Store`

The `Store` to use to store the hit count for each client.

By default, the
[`memory-store`](https://github.com/express-rate-limit/express-rate-limit/blob/main/source/memory-store.ts)
is used.

Here is a list of external stores:
