Express-rate-limit supports external data stores to sychronize hit counts across
multiple processes and servers.

By default, the built-in
[`memory-store`](https://github.com/express-rate-limit/express-rate-limit/blob/main/source/memory-store.ts)
is used. This one does not synchronize it's state across instances. It's simple
to deploy, and often sufficient for basic abuse prevention, but will be
inconnsistent across reboots or in deployments with multiple process or servers.

Deployments requiring more consistently enforced rate limits should use an
external store.

Here is a list of known stores:

| Name                                                                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        | Legacy/Modern API   |
