Basic rate-limiting middleware for [Express](http://expressjs.com/). Use to
limit repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset.
Plays nice with
[express-slow-down](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-slow-down).

## Quickstart

From the `npm` registry:

```sh
# Using npm
> npm install express-rate-limit
# Using yarn or pnpm
> yarn/pnpm add express-rate-limit
```

> Note that this library requires you to use `node` version 16 or above.

An example of its use is as follows:

```ts
// const { rateLimit } = require('express-rate-limit') // Use this for `commonjs` projects.
import { rateLimit } from 'express-rate-limit'

const limiter = rateLimit({
	windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
	limit: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per `window` (here, per 15 minutes).
	standardHeaders: 'draft-7', // draft-6: `RateLimit-*` headers; draft-7: combined `RateLimit` header
	legacyHeaders: false, // Disable the `X-RateLimit-*` headers.
	// store: ... , // Use an external store for more precise rate limiting.
})

// Apply the rate limiting middleware to all requests
app.use(limiter)
```

> **Note:** most stores will require additional configuration, such as custom
> prefixes, when using multiple instances. The default built-in memory store is
> an exception to this rule.
